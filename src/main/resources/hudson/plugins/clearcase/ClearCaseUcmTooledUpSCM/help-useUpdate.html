  <p>If this option is <b>checked</b>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      With <b>snapshot</b> views, Hudson will try to use a snapshot view in the workspace of
      the job that has the name you provided. If the view does not exist, it will be created.
    </li>
    <li>
      With <b>dynamic</b> views, Hudson will try to use a dynamic view that has the name you
      provided. If the view does not exist, it will be created.
    </li>
    <li>
      In both cases, the views won't be deleted even if you try to do a "Wipe out workspace".
      But if you delete the job (and only in that case), the snapshot views (not the dynamic
      ones) generated by this job will be deleted, even if this option is checked.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If this option is <b>unchecked</b>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      With <b>snapshot</b> views, Hudson will try to find a snapshot view in the workspace of
      the job that has the name you provided. <b>If it already exists, it will be deleted.</b> 
      A clean view will then be created.
    </li>
    <li>
      With <b>dynamic</b> views, Hudson will try to find a dynamic view that has the name you
      provided. <b>If it already exists, it will be deleted.</b> A clean view will then be created.
    </li>
    <li>
      When deleting the job or the workspace, the snapshot views (not the dynamic
      ones) generated by this job will be deleted (including workspaces auto-clean operation).
