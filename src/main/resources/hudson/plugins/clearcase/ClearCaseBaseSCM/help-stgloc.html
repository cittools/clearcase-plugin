    Here you can specify a default storage location name where to store the views created by the 
    CleaCase plugin. You will be able to set a specific storage location for each job if you want to.
    If no storage location is specified, the plugin will try the local storage location if any exists.
  </p>

    For information on how to create a storage location see the documentation
