  <p>
  	Normally, all computers that use ClearCase <b>MUST</b> be synchronized on the same 
  	time server.
  </p>
  <p>
  	If your infrastructure does not allow you this, you can specify here the time delta 
  	<b>in seconds</b> between Hudson/Jenkins master computer and your VOBs server. 
  </p>
  <p>
  	Be carefull, if your infrastructure has VOBs on several servers, this &quot;time 
  	shift&quot; will be used <b>without distinction</b> on all of them. This is why it is 
  	better to synchronize all the computers on the same reference.
