  <p>
	This option restricts the baseline creation to the components specified here.
	By default, Hudson will create baselines on all components attached to the stream.
  </p>
  <p>
    The components should be entered with their vob tag, separated by spaces: 
    <tt>comp1@/vobtag comp2@/vobtag comp3@/vobtag ....</tt>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important: </b>if a composite component is specified here, clearcase will create a baseline
    on it on every build. Even if there were no changes in its depending components.
