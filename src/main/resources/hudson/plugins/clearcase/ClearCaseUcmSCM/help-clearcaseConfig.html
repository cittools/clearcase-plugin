    Global clearcase configuration used for this build.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can add/modify configurations in Hudson global setup. These configurations host the 
    following settings:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>cleartool</tt> executable name</li>
      <li>View Storage Location</li>
      <li>Time Window for Merging Event Records</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you let this setting on <tt>(default)</tt>, Hudson will try to find a defined  
    configuration matching the name of the node on which the build is taking place. 
    If no matching configuration can be found in the global settings, 
    Hudson will take the default one.
  </p>
