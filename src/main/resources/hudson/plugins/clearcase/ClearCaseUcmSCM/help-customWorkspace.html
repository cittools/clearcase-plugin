<div>
  <p>
	If you set this field, the value of the variable <tt>${WORKSPACE}</tt> will be changed 
	with the one you provided, with all that that implies for build steps and/or other plugins
	that use this variable. Please note that Hudson's built-in option: <b>custom workspace</b> 
    will also be overriden.
  </p>
  <p>
  	For implementation reasons, the variable will only be changed <b>AFTER</b> the view has been
  	created or started. Therefore, you can use a path that points inside a dynamic view without
  	worrying if the view is already mounted or not.
  </p>
  <p>
  	You can of course use environment variables in this field such as <tt>${CLEARCASE_VIEWPATH}</tt>.
    If you give a relative path, it will be resolved against the path of the view. 
    So <tt>vobs/vob1/component</tt> is equivalent to <tt>${CLEARCASE_VIEWPATH}/vobs/vob1/component</tt>.  
  </p>
